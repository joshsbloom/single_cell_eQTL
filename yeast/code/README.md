# R scripts to perform single-cell eQTL mapping in Boocock et al. 2024

## Analysis of segregants
The main logic for analyzing the segregant data can be found here: [processSegregants.R](processSegregants.R)  
   The R variable `code.dir` should be set to a folder containing the R scripts downloaded from [yeast/code](https://github.com/joshsbloom/single_cell_eQTL/tree/master/yeast/code)  
   Data in processed/ reference/ and cell cycle annotations can be found on [Dryad](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xgxd254qb)
